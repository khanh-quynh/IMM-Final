##### Authors: Quynh K. Nguyen

### About this project

These are 9 Python scripts that build a time-series plots and phase portraits of different variations of a physical pendulum system. 

Two oscillating systems are modelled: bob pendulum system and rod pendulum system, both observed under the absence and effet of drag force.
